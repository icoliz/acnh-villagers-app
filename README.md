# ACNH Villagers App

An application to look up and store data about Animal Crossing New Horizons villagers.

This application will show information about the villagers in ACNH. The information will be extracted from the free [Animal Crossing New Horizons API](http://acnhapi.com/).

**Functionality**
A list of the villagers with their relevant information will be displayed.

Given the information provided by this API, there will be filters to make the search easier:

- name (by typing the villager's name)
- species
- personality (select among 8 options)

There will be also some options that should appear in a different tab:

- saving/removing villagers in a separate list (for instance, villagers you want to move to your island)
- ranking villagers (?)
- adding extra information about them, such as time they stayed etc. will also be considered
